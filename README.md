# Auto Care Hub

The AutoCareHub App's main objective is to develop a user-centric efficient mobile application that offers users a comprehensive solution for users looking for car maintenance and service packages. The app seeks to make scheduling repairs, get replacement parts, and seeking professional mechanic advice easier, while you can also ask queries via chatbot features. Additionally, the app provides a platform for users to remain up to speed on forthcoming auto shows, purchase Auto Show tickets, and reserve their vehicles for auto show participation, increasing the overall experience.

# Proposed system

The AutoCareHub App is a big step forward in the field of mobile applications for automotive services, providing a comprehensive platform that caters to all elements of automobile care and ownership.The AutoCareHub App stands out by merging two vital services on a single platform: Car service packages and spare parts booking. While some similar applications may focus on one of these areas, the combination of both services provides automobile owners with a full answer. This technology has the potential to make troubleshooting easier and repair evaluations more accurate. Furthermore, the app's availability of information about auto shows and ticket booking for auto shows fosters a strong bond between vehicle enthusiasts and the automotive community, encouraging engagement and involvement. Furthermore, the addition of a Chatbot for quick problem-solving provides an interactive and user-friendly layer to the application, ensuring users have easy access to help and guidance. These extra features make the AutoCareHub App an appealing and multifaceted alternative for auto owners looking for simple and comprehensive maintenance services.
